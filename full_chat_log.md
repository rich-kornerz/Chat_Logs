Create a file called full_chat_log.md in the Chat_Logs repository under the owner rich-kornerz. Include the exact and complete contents of this chat from the very beginning up to the current message. The file should have full formatting in Markdown, with clear user and assistant exchanges, and distinguishable timestamps if available.
