I want to build this out using GitHub, Ghost. And what everelse we need that Ghost works with.

Good. We’re going to treat this like a business build, not a content experiment.

Below is the clear operational plan for Grant using Ghost + YouTube + Vault model.

No fluff. Just structure.

⸻

🔐 What We Have

Audience
	•	< 3,000 existing subscribers (paused, not lost)
	•	Recognizable Grant voice + catalog
	•	Existing email list
	•	Strong erotic narrative positioning

Assets
	•	Long-form stories (Heat scale range)
	•	Ability to produce daily if engine exists
	•	Clear tonal identity
	•	Adult affiliate relationships (optional revenue layer)

Decision
	•	Move to self-hosted Ghost
	•	Build independent publishing stack
	•	Use YouTube as top-of-funnel

⸻

🏗 Core Infrastructure

1️⃣ Ghost (Primary Platform)

Ghost becomes:
	•	Website
	•	Blog
	•	Email engine
	•	Membership system
	•	Paid Vault
	•	SEO base
	•	Content archive

Ghost Structure

Public Pages
	•	Home
	•	Listen (YouTube hub)

	•	About Grant
	•	Free Stories

Members-Only
	•	Vault (full explicit archive)
	•	Extended Cuts
	•	Bonus chapters
	•	Early releases

⸻

2️⃣ YouTube (Top of Funnel)

Channel type:
	•	Clean romance
	•	Emotional arcs
	•	Fade-to-black endings
	•	AI narration
	•	PG-13 / light R

Purpose:
	•	Discoverability
	•	Ad revenue
	•	Authority
	•	Traffic driver

Every video ends with:

“Full uncut version in the Vault.”

⸻

3️⃣ Email System (Control Layer)

Ghost handles:
	•	Email capture
	•	Welcome automation
	•	Weekly drops
	•	Referral pushes
	•	Paid member conversion

Goal:
Own audience.
Never depend on platform again.

⸻

🔄 Content Flow Engine

One Core Story → Multi Channel Output

Step 1

Write full Grant story (Heat allowed).

Step 2

Create:
	•	Clean YouTube cut (fade before explicit scene)
	•	Full version stays on Ghost

Step 3

YouTube description:
	•	Link to matching Ghost post
	•	Link to email signup

Step 4

Ghost post includes:
	•	Embedded YouTube video
	•	“Continue reading” behind paywall

⸻

💰 Revenue Layers
	1.	Ghost paid subscriptions
	2.	Affiliate integration (story-native)
	3.	YouTube ad revenue
	4.	Premium bundles (future)
	5.	Audio-only paid drops (future)

Primary revenue:
Ghost subscriptions.

YouTube is acquisition, not the main money.

⸻

📊 Growth Engine

Weekly minimum cadence:
	•	3 YouTube uploads
	•	3 Ghost posts
	•	1 email
	•	2–3 X threads
	•	1 Reddit post

Daily possible later once automation is stable.

🎯 Brand Positioning

⸻

🧭 Strategic Position

You are no longer dependent on:
	•	Substack

	•	Social algorithm swings

You own:
Infrastructure.
Audience.
Distribution.
